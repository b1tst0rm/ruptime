# ruptime
Remote uptime for UNIX servers implemented in C

The server runs on TCP port 44444 and the clients connect to it.

# Instructions
In this problem you are required to write two programs, a client and a server to implement the ruptime Unix shell command.

You should run the server on a certain number (at least three) predefined machines, by typing `ruptimeServer &`

These machines will be known, by either IP number, or host name, to the client. The client will be run on any machine using the command `ruptimeClient`

The client will connect to each of the machines on which the servers are running, and in turn.

When the server is contacted by the client, it will execute the Unix shell command uptime, and send the information returned by uptime to the client.

The client will display the server name, followed by uptime information received from the server.

The client will repeat for all machines in its predefined list, and will then quit. 

Write the two programs in C, or C++ under Unix (Linux, Solaris or IRIX), test them and submit one tar file that contains the following on Canvas:
    The programs in C.
    A makefile to compile both programs.
    An output generated by running the client on the machines of your choice.
